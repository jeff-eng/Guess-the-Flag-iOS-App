# Guess-the-Flag-iOS-App
Repo for my project 'Guess the Flag' iOS app tutorial on www.hackingwithswift.com.

Goal of project is to learn UIKit by making a game, as well as learning about integers, buttons, colors, and actions.

The second part of this project follows Project 6 Auto Layout tutorial at www.hackingwithswift.com.  The goal of the second part of the tutorial is learning how to use Auto Layout and set constraints in Xcode.
